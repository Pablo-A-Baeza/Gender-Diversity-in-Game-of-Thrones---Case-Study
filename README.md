# Gender-Diversity-in-Game-of-Thrones---Case-Study
Analysis of gender diversity of the company Westeros


# Introduction
The purpose of this anaysis is to practice a primary function within People Analytics, a diversity analysis to explore whether or not women/men tend to be under-represented in certain departments within an organization. The data has been extracted from two Github repositories [link](https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones/tree/master/data) and the analysis is based on the chapter 4  *Diversity Analytics* of the book *Predictive HR Analytics by Martin R Edwads & Kirsten Edwards.

# Case
The company Westeros has 13 different departments

* Stark
* Targaryen
* Baratheon
* Lannister
* Night's Watch
* Greyjoy
* Tyrell
* Wildlings
* Martell
* Frey
* Tully
* White Walkers
* Dothraki

As a new People Analyst of Westeros, one of your first fact-finding missions is to explore gender diversity within each company department. This is a paramount analysis, as its findings will enable Bran the broker, former CEO of Westeros and his co-founder, Tyrion Lannister, to ensure that Westeros has a richly diverse workforce.

To do so, you first collected some data from the former employees working for Westeros, their name, gender, and company department.

Once data have been collected, it's time to explore the frequency of employees per department regardless of their sex.

Now, let's explore gender frequency regardless of employees department.
